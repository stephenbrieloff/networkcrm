# Product Requirements Document: Network CRM iOS App

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Network CRM iOS App  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Platform:** iOS Native App

## Vision Statement

Create the fastest, most frictionless iOS app that transforms networking-avoiders into networking champions by making relationship management so simple that it becomes effortless and habitual.

## Core Philosophy: "5-Second Rule"

Every core action in the app must be completable in 5 seconds or less. If someone who has never prioritized networking can't use this app intuitively and immediately, we've failed.

## Problem Statement

**Target Problem:** Professionals who KNOW networking is important but consistently fail to do it because:
- It feels overwhelming and time-consuming
- They don't know what to say or when to reach out
- They forget about people immediately after meeting them
- Existing tools are too complex and require too much setup
- They lack a simple system to track who they've met

**Core Insight:** The biggest barrier isn't capabilityâ€”it's friction. Remove all friction, and networking becomes automatic.

## Target Users

**Primary User Persona: "The Reluctant Networker"**
- Knows networking is important but avoids it
- Gets anxious about follow-up conversations
- Meets people but never stays in touch
- Wants to be better at relationships but doesn't know how to start
- Values efficiency and simplicity above all else

**Secondary Personas:**
- Busy professionals who need dead-simple tools
- Introverts who find networking draining
- People re-entering the workforce who need to rebuild networks

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Instant Capture
- Add a contact in under 5 seconds
- Use camera to scan business cards instantly
- Voice notes for immediate thoughts
- One-tap import from recent contacts/meetings

### 2. Zero Configuration
- Works perfectly out of the box
- No setup wizards or complicated onboarding
- Smart defaults for everything
- Learn user preferences automatically

### 3. Proactive Intelligence
- App suggests when to follow up (don't make users think)
- Pre-written message templates that feel personal
- Automatic reminders based on context
- Smart notifications that actually help

### 4. Native iOS Excellence
- Feels like it belongs on iOS
- Uses platform conventions users already know
- Leverages iOS features (Siri, Shortcuts, Widgets)
- Optimized for one-handed use

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Lightning-Fast Contact Addition
**5-Second Goal: Add someone you just met**

- **Scan Business Card:** Point camera, auto-extract info, tap save
- **Quick Add:** Name + Company in two taps, everything else is optional
- **From Recent:** Import from recent calls/messages with one tap
- **Voice Memo:** Say their name and key details while walking away

### 2. Effortless Follow-Up Reminders
**5-Second Goal: Set a follow-up reminder**

- **Smart Defaults:** App suggests timing based on context (1 day for urgent, 1 week for general, 1 month for casual)
- **One-Tap Scheduling:** "Remind me to follow up" button on every contact
- **Context-Aware:** Knows if it's a new connection vs. existing relationship
- **Natural Language:** "Remind me next week" works perfectly

### 3. Instant Follow-Up Actions
**5-Second Goal: Actually follow up when reminded**

- **Pre-Written Templates:** "Hi [Name], great meeting you at [Event]. Would love to continue our conversation about [Topic]."
- **One-Tap Send:** Choose template, customize if needed, send via preferred method
- **Multiple Channels:** Email, text, LinkedIn message, phone call
- **Smart Suggestions:** App recommends what to say based on previous conversations

### 4. Minimal Note-Taking
**5-Second Goal: Remember important details**

- **Voice Notes:** Speak your thoughts while they're fresh
- **Quick Tags:** One-tap tags like "follow up," "potential client," "mentor"
- **Photo Notes:** Take a quick photo to remember something visual
- **Context Clues:** Where you met, what you talked about, mutual connections

### 5. Relationship Dashboard
**5-Second Goal: See who needs attention**

- **Today's Focus:** 2-3 people you should reach out to today
- **Quick Win List:** Easy follow-ups you can knock out in 5 minutes
- **Relationship Health:** Visual indicators of who you're losing touch with
- **Streak Counter:** Gamification for consistent networking habits

## User Experience Flow

### Onboarding (30 seconds max)
1. "Welcome! Let's add your first contact in 5 seconds"
2. Demo the business card scanner
3. "You're ready to go!"

### Daily Use Pattern
1. **Morning Widget:** "3 people to reach out to today"
2. **Meeting Someone New:** Scan card or quick-add while shaking hands
3. **Walking Away:** Voice note with first impressions
4. **Getting Notification:** One-tap to send follow-up message
5. **Weekly Review:** 2-minute check-in on relationship health
